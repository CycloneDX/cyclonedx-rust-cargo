# CycloneDX Rust (Cargo) Plugin
The CycloneDX module for Rust (Cargo) creates a valid CycloneDX Softare Bill-of-Material (SBoM) containing an aggregate of all project dependencies. CycloneDX is a lightweight SBoM specification that is easily created, human and machine readable, and simple to parse. The resulting bom.xml can be used with tools such as [OWASP Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org/) for the continuous analysis of components.

## Usage
