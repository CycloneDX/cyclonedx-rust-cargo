# CycloneDX Rust (Cargo) Plugin

The CycloneDX module for Rust (Cargo) creates a valid CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) containing an
aggregate of all project dependencies.
OWASP CycloneDX is a full-stack Bill of Materials (BOM) standard providing advanced supply chain capabilities for cyber risk reduction.

## Structure

This repository contains two separate projects:

- [`cyclonedx-bom`](./cyclonedx-bom/README.md) is a Rust library to read and write CycloneDX SBOMs to and from Rust structs.
- [`cargo-cyclonedx`](./cargo-cyclonedx/README.md) is a Rust application, which generates CycloneDX SBOMs for Cargo based Rust projects (it uses `cyclonedx-bom` for that purpose).

## Usage

Execute `cargo-cyclonedx` from within a Rust project directory containing Cargo.toml.

### Installing

```bash
cargo install cargo-cyclonedx
```

### Executing binary

```bash
~/.cargo/bin/cargo-cyclonedx cyclonedx
```

### Executing from cargo

```bash
cargo cyclonedx
```
